# SCALAR Part-of-speech tagger

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL VERSION OF SCALAR

Install requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run via `python3 main --mode run --model_type lm_based`

You can attempt to traint it `python main --mode train --model_type lm_based` -- but I make no guarantees about how easily it will work at this stage

It still technically supports the old gradientboost model, too... but no guarantees as to how well it functions in this branch.
